# TimeManagement

**Goal:**
TimeWise is a user-friendly web application aimed at helping individuals or teams manage their tasks and schedules more efficiently. It offers a visual way to plan daily schedules, set priorities, track progress, and receive reminders, thus minimizing missed deadlines or overlapping events.
